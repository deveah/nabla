An abstract puzzle game
- - -

_Nabla_ is an abstract puzzle game based on the [Four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem).
The player has to color a randomly generated map so that no two neighbouring
territories share the same color.

There's a [live version](https://zalmoxe.faith) if you'd like to play!

Also, contributions to the code, issues, and any kind of suggestions are
encouraged and welcome!

The game uses [Javascript-Voronoi](https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi)
to generate some beautiful maps, [Hammer.JS](http://hammerjs.github.io/) for
input processing, and an adapted version of [point-in-polygon](https://github.com/substack/point-in-polygon). Mad props to the people behind these projects!
